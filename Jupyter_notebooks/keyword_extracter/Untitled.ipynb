unemployment tend to occur and income inequality and poverty levels may rise as the digital revolution mainly destroys jobs in the middle of the wage distribution moreover new technologies automate certain tasks rather than whole occupations so that the task content of occupations changes recent evidence suggests that jobs done by lower educated workers have become substantially less skilled

bariatric surgery the gloria study .  glucose homeostasis metabolomics and pregnancy outcomes after bariatric surgery the gloria study the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide obesity in women is associated with infertility and miscarriages during pregnancy obesity is associated with increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus gdm preeclampsia macrosomia and caesarean delivery for women with a body mass index bmi 40 kg m or bmi 35 kg m with comorbidities bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for their obesity and comorbidities of all patients who undergo bariatric surgery up to 80 are women of childbearing age bariatric surgery causes drastic functional changes in the gastro intestinal tract these operations can be divided into two main types surgeries in which the continuity of the gastro intestinal tract remains intact versus bypass procedures worldwide laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy sg and roux en y gastric bypass rygb respectively are the most commonly performed bariatric surgeries from national cohort studies it is evident that bariatric surgery decreases the risk of obesity related adverse pregnancy outcomes however there is increasing evidence that previous bariatric surgery can have potential harms for both mother and child during pregnancy one of the most striking observations is that babies born from mothers with a history of bariatric surgery are at increased risk of being small for gestational age sga the mechanisms behind this growth retardation are not well understood our hypothesis is that changing glucose homeostasis and metabolite flux from mother to child play an important role a second problem is making an accurate diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus gdm in this population screening for gdm with the standard oral glucose tolerance test ogtt is generally not well tolerated by these women and potentially harming because of reactive hypoglycemia with symptoms of dumping syndrome reactive hypoglycemia occurs in about half of sg and about four out of five of rygb patients that undergo an ogtt in addition because of wide and rapid glycemic excursions the interpretation of these ogtt s is considered unreliable a safer method is self monitoring of blood glucose smbb however this is not a continuous monitoring and does not provide information on glycemic variability and nightly glucose values our hypothesis is that continuous glucose monitoring cgm will provide a more accurate diagnosis of gdm and give more insight into the glucose homeostasis in this population the overall aim of this research project is to explore the metabolism of mother and child during a pregnancy after bariatric surgery the research will therefore focus on the following objectives to determine whether hypoglycemia and glycemic variability measured by cgm during different time points in pregnancy after bariatric surgery are independent risk factors for sga and other adverse pregnancy outcomes to compare the rate of hypoglycemia and glycemic variability between pregnant women after bariatric surgery with age and bmi matched pregnant women without bariatric surgery to determine which metabolites by using metabolomics mediate fetal growth in pregnant women after bariatric surgery compared to pregnant women without bariatric surgery to determine whether there are differences in glucose homeostasis and other metabolites by using metabolomics between rybg and sg to determine the diagnostic accuracy of cgm compared to smbg for the diagnosis of gdm to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on body composition of newborns for this research project the goal is to include 90 women with a history of sg or rygb we will collaborate with six other belgian hospitals based on previous collaborations in the bedip n belgian diabetes in pregnancy study and aurora bariatric surgery registration in women of reproductive age studies we will compare this study

transition of zagros techno typological assessment of lithic assemblages from kaldar cave in the central zagros mountains iran.  research objective the early upper paleolithic period witnessed the replacement of neanderthals and other indigenous populations by homo sapiens the way in which this historic process might be reflected in the archaeological transition from middle to upper palaeolithic material cultures is one of the most questionable subjects in the prehistory of the old world for sure there is no simple one to one relationship between biological and cultural change however before any historical scenario can be forwarded precise knowledge of both the nature and the timing of regional archaeological transitions is a condition sine qua non for the entire region of southwest asia we are far from that we cannot distinguish rapid technological turnovers from gradual technological adjustments nor do we know which species or populations used exactly which lithic production systems as a matter of fact this region is particularly complicated because both neanderthal and early modern human populations have been present here during a long stretch of upper pleistocene time they were using quite a similar middle palaeolithic and middle stone age technologies very much complicating our understanding of the precise path of change towards the upper palaeolithic culture of the aurignacian the latter is considered the hallmark of modern humans entering into europe my research objective is to clarify the origin of the aurignacian both culturally and chronologically while researchers maintain that the discontinuous chronostratigraphic phenomena of neanderthal and homo sapiens exist in the levant it seems that continuity evidence is identified in the western zagros mountains in iran these regions zagros in iran and iraq syria and turkey are the aurignacian and modern human s origin this project will try to find more continuity features to improve the human origin hypothesis by both anthropological and archaeological evidences in the zagros mountains in iran the regional archaeological record the prehistory of the eastern slopes of the zagros mountains is mainly known from the late 1920s through the late 1960s by western pioneers like dorothy garrod hazar merd garrod 1930 carleton coon bisitun tamtama khunik coon 1951 1957 smith

assemblages include early upper paleolithic as well as middle paleolithic features this project will focus on the sequence at kaldar cave it provides an exceptional opportunity to get more detailed analyses of stratigraphy technology and typology of assemblages in this site therefore the intensive re examination of the old collections alongside the analysis of new ones will add significantly to our knowledge of this interesting industry furthermore i shall conduct a wide regional comparative analysis using several near and middle eastern key sites for example the upper levels of the middle palaeolithic sequence of karain on the southern anatolian coast turkey and shanidar of which the lithic material remains virtually unknown it will be very interesting to compare the mousterian from shanidar cave not only with other middle palaeolithic cave sites from the region e g bisitun ghamari gilvaran and kaldar caves and warwasi rock shelter but also with the recently discovered open air sites from iran mirak site upper paleolithic industry appears to be similar to baradostian culture artifacts from zagros mountain in this way i shall be able to address the question of the baradostian this was also uncovered from other cave sites at warwasi and yafteh in iran but its origin still remains controversial the new excavation at kaldar cave would possibly find the arguments for the in situ continuum development of this upper palaeolithic culture from the local mousterian this important information would enhance international debates on the appearance of the first cultures attributed to anatomically modern humans in near east and europe materials and methods the artifacts will be analyzed from a techno typological method recording the types of raw materials used production techniques and the chronological framework the lithic assemblages will be studied following an integrated methodology including taphonomical technological and typological analyses with

hammerstones debris importance of the research the data obtained from the proposed excavation will contribute new data to our knowledge of the neanderthals and homo sapiens in the western zagros mountains of iran this project will help to build a comprehensive framework of the migration path of modern humans from central asia to europe and will enhance a global position of the area in paleolithic studies our project will be synthesized during an integrative analytic and interpretive research phase the synthesis will include the different aspects of the arrival of modern human 39 s culture technology subsistence settlement patterns etc considered within a refined chronological framework and provide an interpretation for the behavior and adaptations of modern humans as they

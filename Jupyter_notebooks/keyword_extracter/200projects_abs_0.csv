1ec1c1c6-a6db-491b-b8df-5c02c82a6a96,Greenberg schemes and the motivis Serre invariant ,['010105'], p In this thesis we use logarithmic methods to study motivic objects br Let R be a complete discrete valuation ring with perfect residue field k and denote by K its fraction field br We give in chapter 2 a new construction of the motivic Serre invariant of a smooth K variety and extend it additively to arbitrary K varieties br The main advantage of this construction is to rely only on resolution of singularities and not on a characteristic zero assumption as did previous results br As an application we give a conditional positive answer to Serre 39 s question on the existence of rational fixed points of a G action on the affine space for G a finite l group br We end the chapter by showing how the logarithmic point of view that we use in our construction leads to a new understanding of the motivic nearby cycles with support of Guibert Loeser and Merle as a motivic volume p p In chapter 4 we use the theory of logarithmic geometry to derive a new formula for the motivic zeta function via the volume Poincar series br More precisely we show how to compute the volume Poincar series associated to a generically smooth log smooth R scheme in terms of its log geometry more specifically in terms of its associated fan in the sense of Kato br This formula yields a much smaller set of candidate poles for the motivic zeta function and seems especially well suited to tackle the monodromy conjecture of Halle and Nicaise for Calabi Yau K varieties for which log smooth models appear naturally through the Gross Siebert programme on mirror symmetry br We end the chapter by showing how this formula sheds new light on previous results regarding the motivic zeta function of a polynomial nondegenerate with respect to its Newton polyhedron and of a polynomial in two variables p ,['Invariant']

safety issue Since the intake of i N lt gt nitrosamine contaminated food may induce all kinds of cancer tumors the presence of these carcinogens must be reduced to the lowest possible concentrations below the limit of detection Also in meat products br i N lt gt Nitrosamines can regularly be detected although mostly in low concentrations Generally it is assumed that i N lt gt nitrosamines are formed by the nitrosation of a secondary amine with a nitrosating agent In dry fermented sausages the nitrosating agent mainly originates from sodium nitrite which is added to the meat as preservative and colouring agent In addition during the fermentation and the subsequent ripening period microorganisms can decarboxylate amino acid to biogenic amines These biogenic amines some of which can cause food poisoning themselves may be transformed to the secondary amines which are the direct precursors of i N lt gt nitrosamines Therefore biogenic amines are considered to be a risk for the formation of i N lt gt nitrosamines in dry fermented sausages However this hypothesis has not been confirmed experimentally yet Therefore the objective of this work was to gain additional insight in the occurrence and formation of N nitrosamines in relation to nitrite and the accumulation ofbiogenic amines in dry fermented sausages More specifically the studywas focused on the mechanism of i N lt gt nitrosopiperidine NPIP formation in a dry fermented sausage model br Firstly a method was optimised for the determination of biogenic amines in dry fermented sausages To increase the sensitivity a derivatisation was necessary Thereforethe commonly used dansylation was compared to an alternative dabsylation procedure The derivatisation with dabsyl chloride was preferred sinceit was realized in 25 min at 70 C instead of 45 min at 40 C which is a substantial time gain The interferences in the chromatogram which originated from the complex protein fat matrix were removed bya solid phase extraction SPE As a result a reliable and sensitive method was developed to determine the biogenic amines i e tryptamine TRYP phenylethylamine PHE putrescine PUT cadaverine CAD histamine HIS serotonin SER tyramine TYR and the natural polyamines spermidine SPD en spermine SPM in dry fermented sausages br Next the concentrations of i N lt gt nitrosamines biogenic amines and residual nitrite were determined in 101 commercial dry fermented sausages which were available on the Belgian market In this way the food safetyof the commercial products in relation to the occurrence of these compounds were assessed In general the product could be considered safe since the concentrations of biogenic amines and i N lt gt nitrosamines remained low Traces of i N lt gt nitrosomorpholine NMOR and NPIP were found in 22 and 28 of the samples respectively In some cases 3 the NPIP concentrations were measured in quantifiable concentrations above the method quantification limit MQL of 2 5 g kg In addition principal component analysis PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis HCA were used in to search for patterns in the occurrence of biogenic amines and i N lt gt nitrosamines in the commercial meat products and their relation with physical and chemical characteristics However no correlation could be observed between the i N lt gt nitrosamine contamination and the amounts of biogenic amines or the physical and chemical characteristics Moreover the contamination with i N lt gt nitrosamines could not be linked to a specific type of dry fermented sausage br To study the i N lt gt nitrosamine formation the use of a dry fermented sausage model produced under strictly controlled conditions Good Manufactruing Practices GMP was preferred In the technicum ofthe Research Group of Technology and Quality of Animal Products a North European type dry fermented sausage was developed The physical pH 61 5 1 and aw 61 0 93 and chemical salt moisture fatand protein content were 3 5 42 9 32 0 and 19 0 g 100g respectively characteristics were comparable with results found for commercial products In addition no extreme biogenic amine accumulation and no N nitrosamine formation was observed during the production of the dry fermentedsausage model Therefore this model was proven to be suitable for the study of the br i N lt gt nitrosamine formation br In the second part of this work the NPIP formation was studied in detail since the commercial samples were mainly contaminated with NPIP br By means of the dry fermented sausage model the role of the biogenic amine CAD and the direct precursor piperidine PIP on the formation of NPIP was studied during the production of dry fermented sausages In this study the influence of pH 4 9 and 5 3 sodium nitrite 0 and 150 mg kg and sodium ascorbate 0 and 500 mg kg was investigated When the meat batter was enriched with CAD 500 mg kg cadaverine dihydrochloride CAD 2HCl no increased NPIP concentrations were observed In contrast the enrichment with PIP 10 and 100 mg kg resulted in an increased NPIP formation On the one hand no effect on the NPIP formation was seen by the small difference in pH On the other hand the NPIP formation was significantly higher when the sausages were prepared with sodium nitrite and when sodium ascorbate was omitted In the case that PIP was present in excessive amounts nitrite could be identified as source of the nitrosating agent Also the role of ascorbate as inhibitor of N nitrosamine formation was confirmed However this effect could only be observed in the beginning of the production since NPIP degraded during the subsequent production phases br In the next part the influence of pH and aw on the NPIP formation was investigated using two protein based liquid systems In the first system NaCl system the NaCl concentration 0 30 was varied to reduce the aw between 0 99 and 0 79 at two pH levels 4 0 and 5 0 Atboth pH levels the reduction of aw resulted in a decreased amount of NPIP However the applied NaCl concentrations necessary for the reduction of aw were much higher than the NaCl content in dry fermented sausages ca 3 As a consequence it was unclear to what extent this effectcould be attributed to the higher ionic strength or the lower aw In a second system PEG system poly ethylene glycol PEG was used to reduce the aw Response surface methodology RSM was applied to evaluate thecombined effect of pH 3 0 7 0 aw 0 80 0 99 and the incubation time 1 3 98 7 h on the NPIP formation It was observed that the NPIPconcentrations increased when the incubation time was longer the aw was higher and the pH was lower The results obtained in the liquid systems contributed to a better understanding of the inhibition of the NPIP formation during the production of dry fermented sausages Hereby the possible NPIP formation partially promoted by a slight acidification during the fermentation is inhibited by the reduction of aw br Finally it was investigated if the presence of NPIP in dry fermented sausages can emanate from the use of NPIP contaminated spices First analytical methods were developed to determine the precursors namely piperine and PIP in the spices Piperine was determined by HPLC DAD 61 343 nm after accelerated solvent extraction ASE with dichloromethane DCM To determine PIP a hydroextraction by means of ASE followed by HPLC ELSD was applied Commonly used spices in dry fermented sausages i e paprika i Capsicum annuum lt gt chilli i Capsicum frutescens lt gt allspice i Pimenta dioica lt gt and nutmeg i Myristica fragrans lt gt contained only traces of both precursors Only in samples of black and white pepper high concentrations of piperine max 21 12 mg g and PIP max 11 42 mg g were measured However the addition of piperine and PIP containing spices in nitrite curing salt mixtures did not always result in the formation of NPIP Only in the mixture containing white pepper a small amount of NPIP 9 8 ng g was detected after a two month storage period However this amount was not sufficient to explain the sporadic occurrence of quantifiable concentrations of NPIP in commercial dry fermented sausages It should be noticed that the storage conditions were optimal and the storage time was relatively short Future studies are needed to reveal if changed storage conditions can result in increased amounts of NPIP in the spice mixtures br The results obtained in this work demonstrated that in general the risk of i N lt gt nitrosamine contamination in dry fermented sausages is low On the one hand it was proven that the accumulation of biogenic amines especially with regard to CAD will not result in the formation of NPIP during the production of dry fermented sausages On the other hand NPIP can be formed from PIP but only when extreme concentrations of PIP are present Common amounts of PIP which can be introduced in the sausage by the additionofPIP containing spices are not a risk for the formation of NPIP The sporadic occurrence of quantifiable concentrations in commercial dry fermented sausages will probably be attributed to the use of highly NPIP contaminated spice mixtures i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i

404c1f7c-7865-4bcb-aef6-1511cf6a3dff,Off Modern Catholic Aesthetics Rethinking the Role of Religion in 20th Century Art and Architecture,['060302'], p The PhD thesis centres on analysing connections between aesthetic modernism and traditional Catholic ideas In terms of scope it examines transnational intellectual transfers between Europe and the US primarily between 1945 and 1970 To do so methodological tools derived from intellectual history are employed to observe how concepts which were mobilised from different disciplines sought to maintain a sacred conception of aesthetics within a rapidly changing post World War II social environment By analysing aesthetics and theology in tandem the aim of the research is to construct both an alternative aesthetic historiography which takes into consideration the role of religion in processes of modernisation and to mobilise a philosophical aesthetics which emerges from encounters between tradition and the avant garde This operated along two core fault lines firstly the socio economic context of inter war France and secondly in terms of the transplanted intellectual where ideas which were initially conceived in Europe found their final articulation in the US after World War II p p p p In terms of methodology the thesis draws on the historiographic approaches of Reinhart Koselleck and Hans Blumenberg In this respect the dynamics between traditional Catholic ideas and modernist aesthetics is framed within two main categories firstly it draws on Koselleck s notion of sediments of time to explore the conflicted temporalities at work between the medieval and modern conceptions of architecture In the second instance it analyses how Catholic educators sought to leverage the horizon of expectation with the space of experience by mobilizing religious ideas in a modern pedagogical context This broader intellectual horizon is channelled into specific case studies whereby a facet of the secular religious dynamics of modernist aesthetics is given a sharper conceptual focus Archival material is used as the basis for the argument of each chapter Moreover it draws on Hans Blumenberg s early work on metaphorology to connect these micro texts to the broader historical context in which they appeared namely post World War II America p p p p The first chapter examines the theoretical discourse on architecture of the Dominican friar and art critic Marie Alain Couturier 1897 1954 Having trained to become an artist at the em Ateliers d 39 art em em sacr em in Paris 1920 1925 and a theologian at Le Saulchoir and Rome 1925 1932 Couturier was situated between the emergence of aesthetic modernism and a Catholic intellectual framework undergoing major transformations in the first half of the 20th century This chapter is divided into three parts which offer a theoretical backdrop for the remaining three case studies First an anti modern paradigm based on romantic anti capitalism wherein Couturier s thinking was characterised by a radically anti republican politics on the one hand and a Neo Thomist aesthetics on the other The second part looks at Couturier s fraternal Catholic modernism where his framework shifted towards embracing existential hermeneutics Finally it examines how the contradictions at work in Couturier s framework come to the fore in his analysis of modern sacred architecture p p The second chapter examines the clash of temporalities between the medieval and modern by looking at a specific building namely Marcel Breuer s 1902 1981 futurist design for Benedictine chapel in Collegeville Minnesota 1953 1961 Here Breuer used innovations from modernist architecture and engineering techniques Accordingly the chapter is framed as a negotiation between aesthetic discourses of industry modernism on the one hand and mysticism tradition on the other The analysis is split into two parts First the continuities and discrepancies between Breuer s and the Benedictines respective conceptions of architectural symbolism is dissected Second the chapter engages a comparative investigation between the former Bauhaus teacher Josef Albers conception of the spiritual in art with the more public understanding of symbolism within Benedictine frameworks p p The third chapter analyses the impact which the phenomenon of religious conversion had on the educational philosophy of the curator activist and philanthropist Dominique de Menil 1908 1997 During the late 1930s de Menil was immersed in the renaissance of Catholic intellectual life in France After a series of geographic displacements de Menil translated these ideas into her artistic and activist pursuits in Houston after World War II The first part examines the intellectual origins of de Menil s conversion to Catholicism The second part scrutinises the bearing of these ideas in the context of her educational and curatorial agenda in the US after World War II p p Finally the concept of crisis is analysed in post World War II architectural education in the US This is done through the lens of an influential educator Jean Labatut 1899 1986 During his time as the Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Architecture in Princeton 1928 1967 Labatut developed a unique form of research based on the development of visual sensibility which he implemented in his architectural laboratory As a progressive Catholic Labatut thought that religious ideas could be integrated within modernist buildings and urban planning The first part unpacks Labatut s framework within the rubrics of visuality phenomenology history and religion Part two explores how these ideas were taken up in the post war intellectual landscape via two of his student s theses Francis Prokes and Robert Venturi p p In their respective ways the protagonists of the research sought to reconcile fundamentally heterogenous conceptions of time Concepts which were derived from a medieval context were placed alongside modern concepts The thesis therefore concludes with a reflection on what a re examination of this clash of temporalities between the medieval and the modern can contribute to debates in the historiographic sciences In terms of impact can be seen as a contribution to the fields of Art History as a reconsideration of the role religion played in 20th century aesthetics Religious Studies as a reflection on the process whereby Catholic ideas underwent complex and contradictory transformations and Intellectual History a reflection on what new forms of temporality and periodisation a clash between the medieval and the modern can produce p ,"['Apocryphal Modernism', 'Apostolic Modernism']"

7a059ea6-ca95-403a-a545-6466a613b55c,The rationale for repurposing cidofovir to selectively target HPV positive and negative epithelial neoplasias,"['010608', '010611', '030116', '030120', '030616', '030620']", p Human papillomaviruses HPVs are double stranded DNA viruses of which the mucosal alpha types can induce benign low risk HPV types and malignant high risk HPV types lesions High risk HPVs are associated with cervical cancer other anogenital cancers and a substantial amount of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC Effective prophylactic vaccines are available but are mostly administered to young women and older women and men remain unvaccinated although male HPV vaccination programs have been implicated in several countries Current treatment is based on surgery radio and or chemotherapy which can be associated with significant side effects Furthermore high recurrence rates are described in cases of advanced HPV disease Thus the development of a selective therapy capable of inducing regression of the existing HPV lesions preventing the progression of low grade disease and or preventing recurrences is highly required p p Cidofovir CDV is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate with antiviral activity against a broad range of DNA viruses CDV proved to have antiproliferative effects against several HPV 43 and HPV cell lines em in vitro em and in a murine xenograft model of HPV 43 tumors and in a cotton tail rabbit PV model CDV has been demonstrated to be active in different severe clinical presentations of both benign and malignant HPV associated diseases including recurrent respiratory papillomatosis gingival and oral neoplasias verruca vulgaris plantar warts severe laryngeal papillomatosis anogenital lesions hypopharyngeal esophageal tumors anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 3 vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stages 2 43 and 3 CDV also demonstrated activity em in vivo em against HPV malignancies such as glioblastoma hemangiosarcoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma p p p p First we aimed to further unravel the selective mode of action of CDV against both HPV 43 and HPV transformed cells compared to normal cells Previously our laboratory performed whole genome gene expression profiling by means of microarrays in two HPV 43 cervical carcinoma cells HPV immortalized keratinocytes and normal keratinocytes The data suggested activation of cell cycle regulation and double strand break DSB repair mechanisms ATM signaling and DSB repair by homologous recombination following CDV treatment of normal cells in contrast to HPV 43 and HPV transformed cells Based on these findings we then compared HPV 43 and HPV cervical cancer and HNSCC cell lines with immortalized keratinocytes HaCaT and normal cells primary human keratinocytes primary epithelial tonsil cells and human embryonic lung fibroblasts for their sensitivity to CDV drug metabolism incorporation of the active metabolite into cellular DNA and DNA damage induction Chapter 2 Tumor cells proved to be more sensitive to CDV antiproliferative effects and incorporated more CDV diphosphate than normal cells To confirm the induction of DSBs by CDV ATM activation was evaluated in the different cell types Upon CDV treatment the different cell types presented an increase in phospho ATM levels Detection of H2AX a quantitative marker of DSBs showed a significant increase in DSBs in tumor cells but not in normal cells following CDV exposure CDV antiproliferative effects correlated with incorporation of the active CDV metabolite into cellular DNA which was related to induction of DNA damage However CDV induced DNA damage and antiproliferative effects did not correlate indicating that the mode of action of CDV against cancer cells cannot be attributed solely to DNA damage The effects of CDV on cell growth incorporation into DNA and induction of DNA damage were independent of tumor type i e originating from cervical or head and neck tissues and of HPV status Based on these results proteins downstream of ATM in the homologous recombination repair pathway i e p16 BRCA1 BRCA2 and RAD51 were investigated Chapter 3 HPV 43 and HPV tumor cells accumulated CDV induced DSBs as indicated by an accumulation of RAD51 foci while normal cells resolved RAD51 foci highlighting their capacity to repair CDV induced DSBs RAD51 foci formation in tumor cells was not linked to p16 overexpression which was not altered by CDV treatment In addition no difference in accumulation of DSBs was observed between HPV 43 and HPV cell lines These results indicate that CDV em in vitro em antitumor activity is not restricted to HPV 43 tumor cells but could be expanded to HPV cervical carcinomas and HNSCC tumors although further studies including different tumor cell lines with diverse genetic backgrounds are mandatory before CDV can be proposed as a broad antitumor agent p p p p The second part of this PhD project aimed to investigate tumor tumor interactions using a double subcutaneous xenograft model in athymic nude mice where the two tumors had no direct contact We also explored whether intratumoral treatment with CDV would not only have a local antitumor effect as previously demonstrated by our research group but also a far reaching effect leading to retarded growth of a secondary tumor Chapter 4 Clinical evidence for tumor tumor interactions within one organism exist for several malignancies but not for cervical cancer We provided evidence that the presence and the site of a primary HPV 43 xenograft had no influence on the growth of a secondary distant HPV 43 xenograft However CDV em in situ em treatment of the primary xenograft had a temporary far reaching antitumor effect leading to retarded growth of the challenged tumor In addition volume reduction of the primary xenograft lowered the mortality and pathology associated with total tumor burden as indicated by a reduction in splenomegaly inflammation and an increase in antitumor immune responses The effects of CDV on a secondary untreated HPV 43 xenograft is likely mediated by an indirect activation of an antitumor immune response and inhibition of inflammation Since the far reaching effect of CDV was transient we investigated the use of apoptotic tumor cells as a source of a wide variety of tumor antigens able to induce a more integral immune response and co administration of CDV together with vaccine adjuvants aluminum hydroxyde 43 monophosphoryl lipid A in an attempt to boost CDV far reaching effects Chapter 4 Apoptotic tumor cells were unable to delay the growth of a secondary xenograft implanted subcutaneously Adjuvant per se slightly reduced the growth of both the first and the second xenograft but this effect was not synergistic with CDV treatment of the primary xenograft p p p p In conclusion this doctoral thesis contributes to a better insight into the selective mechanism of CDV antitumor activity which is crucial for the development of new strategies to treat HPV associated neoplasias Cidofovir is not only able to decrease the volume of a locally treated xenograft but also to reduce inflammation and to direct the immune response in such a way to be favorable to the host These are important findings in view of the accumulating evidence showing that the immune system has a critical role in the process of tumorigenesis Our work sets up the basis for further investigations on CDV as an inducer of DNA damage against both HPV 43 and HPV tumors and the potential of combination therapy and warrants the development of improved pharmacological formulations of CDV p p p p p ,"['Cidofovir', 'Human papillomavirus', 'DNA damage']"

Kinases RIPK within the tyrosine kinase like family These kinases are crucial mediators of inflammation regulated cell death necroptosis and apoptosis and survival Two aspects of RIPK1 will determine cellular fate RIPK1 kinase activity initiates apoptosis or necroptosis upon activation the latter occurring in caspase 8 deficient conditions and RIPK1 also functions as a scaffold protein that is directly involved in inflammatory gene expression and cell survival This scaffolding function is independent of its kinase activity Necroptosis is a form of regulated necrotic cell death initiated by several receptors like TNFR1 toll like receptors IFNAR1 and is characterized by a signaling cascade with sequential phosphorylation of both RIPK1 and RIPK3 that will form a complex called necrosome This necrosome will result in phosphorylation and activation of mixed lineage kinase domain like protein MLKL a pseudokinase that was identified as a downstream substrate of RIPK3 and executioner of necroptosis Necroptosis leads to the release of damage associated molecular patterns DAMPs and cytokines which cause an inflammatory response that results in various pathological conditions As activation of RIPK1 and or RIPK3 is important for the execution of necroptosis and these kinases are involved in many pathological conditions including ischemic insults inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases they are promising therapeutic targets As necrostatin 1 the first described RIPK1 inhibitor has moderate potency specificity and a narrow SAR profile novel RIPK1 inhibitors are needed with higher therapeutic potential The first part of this thesis focused on the identification and characterization of novel small molecule RIP kinase inhibitors with therapeutic potential to alleviate RIPK1 3 driven inflammatory disorders and tissue injury in mice With high content screenings we identified Sorafenib tosylate a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF as a potent inhibitor of necroptosis targeting RIPK1 and RIPK3 On the other hand rational design of structural analogues of Tozasertib an aurora kinase inhibitor shown to bind RIPK1 was used to develop novel RIPK1 inhibitors targeting the active kinase conformation Aurora kinases regulate several phases during mitosis including cytokinesis splitting of one cell to two daughter cells and inhibition of aurora kinases results in mitotic defects deficient cytokinesis and eventually cell death Here we succeeded to develop novel Tozasertib analogues with increased specificity for RIPK1 Both Sorafenib tosylate as well as the Tozasertib analogues protected against a RIPK1 3 driven inflammatory disorder em in vivo em p p Necroptotic cell death is not only relevant in inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders but has also relevance in cancer Cancers acquire several capabilities in order to survive during the multistep process in tumor development Resisting cell death is one of them Deregulation of RIPK1 RIPK3 has been reported in several cancer types but little is known about the role of necroptosis executor MLKL in tumorigenesis and tumor development A few contradictory results on the possible association between MLKL expression and cancer prognosis have been reported On the one hand low MLKL expression is associated with decreased overall survival rates in colon cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma On the other hand higher levels of activated MLKL phospho MLKL associated with lower survival rates in esophagus cancer and colon cancer The contribution of MLKL regulation and activation during tumor development is therefore still obscure Additionally MLKL may have cell death independent functions that influence tumor development In the second part of this thesis the role of MLKL in melanoma was explored using patient derived melanoma cell lines and a genetic mouse melanoma model driven by BRAF mutation and PTEN deletion This model mimics the mutational load that occurs in human melanoma and results in constitutive activation of the RAS RAF MEK ERK MAPK signaling pathway that drives cell survival and proliferation in melanocytes Upon increased mutational load benign nevi will develop towards melanoma with radial expansion followed by vertical growth into the dermis and metastasis This metastatic process is facilitated by the high plasticity of melanoma cells including induction of ZEB1 a critical activator of epithelial to mesenchymal transition EMT that increases the invasiveness of melanoma cells We found an intriguing positive correlation between MLKL and ZEB1 expression in melanoma suggesting a possible functional link between MLKL and EMT like processes Also in patients low MLKL RNA expression levels seem to result in higher survival rates although this has no prognostic value to date Although invasive melanoma cells express RIPK1 RIPK3 and MLKL they are not sensitive to necroptosis Understanding the necroptotic resistance mechanisms in melanoma will be crucial for the development of cell death based therapies Finally MLKL has a modest but significant role in melanoma nevi growth p ,"['necroptosis',

based foods has grown significantly due to increasing health awareness As a complement of wheat flour in milling wheat bran represents a self evident source of dietary fibre In addition wheat bran is a good source of minerals vitamins and bioactive compounds However consumption of wheat bran enriched foods remains low since its incorporation in cereal based foods poses important issues during processing and concerning final product quality Some of these issues are addressed by using expensive food additives The lack of insight into the root causes of these problems prevents developing strategies to solve them in another way The incorporation of bran in wheat bread a staple food all around the world represents an interesting system to study the impact of bran on the various aspects of starch and gluten functionality since starch and gluten constitute the major structure determining components in bread Indeed in breadmaking proper gluten network development as a result of hydration and mixing is required proper leavening relies on the stability of the gluten starch matrix during fermentation and oven rise and gelatinisation of starch upon baking determines the eventual crumb structure p p Against this background this doctoral dissertation aimed to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of wheat bran on gluten and starch functionality in breadmaking To this end the alteration of bran properties by different innovative modification techniques was investigated and used as a research tool p p The possibility to induce physicochemical modifications in wheat bran was investigated using microfluidisation wet milling or dry milling Microfluidisation processing parameters pressure number of passes bran concentration and initial particle size and water content during milling strongly influenced the physicochemical properties of wheat bran The three applied techniques were able to produce ultrafine wheat bran samples with a median particle size between 21 m and 29 m but the physicochemical characteristics were not only determined by the particle size but also by the technique of particle size reduction Wet milling and microfluidisation with subsequent freeze drying resulted in a higher surface area and strong water retention capacity than dry milling The wet environment during particle size reduction with microfluidisation or wet milling results in penetration of water into the wheat bran structure and an increase in porosity after freeze drying It also promotes the activity of endogenous enzymes which increases the water extractable content of the wheat bran With the different modification techniques a sample set with diverse physicochemical properties was obtained p p To study the effect of modified wheat bran on the starch gelatinisation temperature the water distribution between starch and bran was investigated Dynamic water vapour sorption and water retention capacity experiments showed that fine dry milled wheat bran bound up to three times more water than starch However examining starch gelatinisation in starch bran water mixtures with differential scanning calorimetry showed that the effect of substituting starch by bran differed from that of moving into a regime of limiting water Modelling the effect of the mixture composition on starch gelatinisation behaviour indicated that the onset and peak gelatinisation temperatures were positively correlated with the bran concentration in water Extractable wheat bran components such as potassium and phosphorus were mainly held responsible for this effect as they decrease the plasticisation capacity of the solvent The conclusion temperature was negatively correlated with the water content Our observations were mechanistically explained with the side chain liquid crystalline polymeric model for starch p p The effect of modified wheat bran on gluten functionality was investigated in a gluten starch mixture as a simplified model system for flour A proper gluten network microstructure as visualised with confocal laser scanning microscopy could be achieved in the presence of modified wheat bran However significant effects of the type of wheat bran water absorption and mixing time on uniaxial extensional dough rheology and loaf volume were observed Wheat bran addition decreased the strain hardening of dough despite optimisation of water absorption and mixing time The deleterious effect of wheat bran on dough rheology increased by adding modified wheat bran with high strong water retention capacity and surface area The strain hardening behaviour of dough proved to be a valuable predictor of bread loaf volume also in the presence of modified wheat bran p p Finally a wheat flour based bread system was used to obtain more insight into the impact of modified wheat bran during the different phases of the breadmaking process The incorporation of 10 bran affected the volume increase of dough mainly from the baking phase on while in the presence of 20 bran the fermentation phase was also affected The decrease in gas retention during fermentation could be linked to a decrease in strain hardening as was also observed for gluten starch mixtures However the behaviour of native gluten in flour could not be entirely mimicked by isolated gluten The major effect of modified wheat bran on dough rheology was already present immediately after mixing Water redistribution during fermentation caused by the hydration properties of wheat bran was therefore suggested to be of minor importance The changes in dough rheology were mainly attributed to the production of yeast metabolites and the expansion itself The effect of wheat bran on the oven rise could not be attributed to the impact of wheat bran on starch gelatinisation or water ethanol evaporation during baking Dough rheology was therefore also during baking identified as the main reason for the observed differences in the volume increase of the dough The strong water retention capacity of wheat bran was furthermore shown to affect evaporation during baking which will affect the final bread quality p p In conclusion this dissertation studied the effect of modified wheat bran on starch and gluten functionality during breadmaking It was shown that mainly the hydration properties of wheat bran influence gluten functionality and consequently dough rheology This leads to a decrease in gas retention during fermentation and even more pronounced during baking Finally this results in a decreased loaf volume Although starch gelatinisation is affected mainly by water extractable components of wheat bran this is of minor importance during breadmaking The explored wheat bran modification techniques could help to align wheat bran functionality with different

p Strawberry fruit is worldwide one of the most popular fruits typically praised for its flavour Flavour can be subdivided into taste and aroma the latter being the main driver for consumer perception and appreciation Strawberry has one of the most complex aromas consisting of many different components comprised of different chemical classes To measure aroma gas chromatography mass spectrometry GC MS is currently considered the golden standard However this technique is quite time consuming and given the large sample sizes needed to account for biological variation not applicable for high throughput analyses This thesis therefore aimed to apply a new technique called selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry SIFT MS for the measurements of strawberry aroma p p SIFT MS was originally developed to study ion molecule reactions in interstellar clouds in the 1980s Since then it has expanded its scope to more earthly topics including food science Unlike most analytical MS techniques SIFT MS does not require calibration and can be applied in real time Furthermore it can measure the sample directly as no sample pre treatment or concentration is necessary Since SIFT MS lacks a chromatographic step the impact of this reduced information content was studied in an exploratory study by reconstructing datasets of reduced information content from GC MS data mimicking the output of SIFT MS The effect of this reduced information content was studied to see how this would affect the discriminating power of the aroma analyses compared to the standard deconvolution method in which both the chromatographic and mass spectral information are used Both the total ion chromatogram and the cumulative mass spectrum successfully discriminated large differences such as differences between cultivars but smaller differences such as intra cultivar variation proved difficult to detect and in both approaches the reproducibility was less compared to the deconvolution method p p After the exploratory data study the feasibility of SIFT MS for strawberry aroma measurements and its strengths and weaknesses were investigated and compared to GC MS SIFT MS and GC MS were used in parallel to measure the aroma of strawberries at different stages of ripening Compared to GC MS the SIFT MS analyses were 11 times as fast Both techniques showed similar results however the limit of detection of SIFT MS seemed lower since the data points were more evenly distributed over the principal component analysis PCA plot whereas the GC MS samples showed more overlap The most important volatiles per ripening stage red or green were tentatively identified based on the GC MS data Since GC MS requires sample pre treatment which in general is a blending step with salt the pre treated samples were measured with SIFT MS as well to also study the effect of sample treatment on analysis This showed that artefacts may possibly be introduced by the treatment but this needs further research p p One of the weaknesses of SIFT MS is its kinetic library which is far smaller than the widespread GC MS spectral library of the National Institute of Standards NIST Three strawberry specific compounds ethyl isovalerate mesifuran and em trans em 2 hexenyl acetate were studied and their reaction rate constants and product ion distribution were determined and added to the kinetic library for further use in this dissertation The knowledge of these parameters will allow for the identification and quantification of these compounds and eventually to the calculation of odour activity values p p Currently quantification of SIFT MS mass spectra is done using the m z values that do not suffer from overlapping fragments This often results in the use of only one m z value and this makes quantification of complex samples almost impossible Therefore a new data analysis methodology that uses the full spectra of all three reagent ions was developed The method is based on fitting the measured SIFT MS spectrum to a calculated spectrum that is based on previously selected compounds with known SIFT MS spectrum The method was tested and its applicability discussed based on the analysis of different samples The best results were obtained in samples of simple and known composition the methodology is not suited for analysis of complex or unknown samples The selection of compounds at the start and fragments that share m z values complicate the analysis and may lead to incorrect identification and quantification of volatiles The applicability of the method to compound identification was tested but proved merely statistical and had no realistic value the compounds identified by the software were not present in the actual sample of which the composition was known Another issue is the yet limited SIFT MS kinetic library which it is not as complete as for GC MS so product ions of unknown compounds can be incorrectly assigned to known compounds Furthermore the library does not contain much information on secondary products H2O adducts since their formation is humidity dependent These secondary products may have an effect on the product ion distribution and intensities though This can be overcome by studying the compounds of interest under the conditions of the sample since then not only the secondary products will be known but also the ratio of primary to secondary products Further modifications of the method are required to decrease false positive identifications of volatiles that are not present in the headspace Finally tentative odour activity values were calculated for the sensory most relevant strawberry compounds however these values have to be interpreted with caution since the quantification is dependent on the compound selection at the start and overlapping product ions might be assigned to the wrong compound p p This research has demonstrated that SIFT MS can be successfully applied in the field of postharvest biology and technology It can serve as a fast technique to classify fruits based on their spectral fingerprint according to cultivar ripening stage moment of harvest and in the future probably also storage condition Disadvantages are the lack of chromatography and the incompleteness of the library Another means of introducing a separation step to SIFT MS would be the use of a thermal desorption unit which would separate volatile compounds based on their boiling points and introduce them to the SIFT MS consecutively With regards to the completeness of the SIFT MS kinetic library new compounds can be added by studying their reactions with the three reagent ions H3O 43 NO 43 and O2 43 With regards to humidity it would be advised to study these reactions under the conditions of the final sample since as such the possibility and extent of H2O cluster formation will be accounted for p ,"['aroma', 'strawberry', 'GC MS', 'SIFT MS']"

are potential new targets for HIV therapy Our research group is particularly interested in the identification and validation ofcellular cofactors of HIV integrase IN One of those cellular cofactors is transportin SR2 TRN SR2 TNPO3 transportin 3 We discovered TRN SR2 in 2008 in a yeast two hybrid screen using HIV IN as a bait and identified it as the nuclear import factor of HIV Although TRN SR2 was identified as an interactor of HIV IN TRN SR2 has alternatively been proposed to exert its role by interacting with the viral capsid CA protein Indeed a CA mutant N74D was shown to render HIV independent of TRN SR2 under certain experimental settings Different groups confirmed that TRN SR2 knockdown reduces the nuclear import of HIV but the exact mechanism remains controversial In this work we studied the role of TRN SR2 during HIV replication br br We focused on the following objectives br 1 Understanding the effect of the N74D capsid mutant on TRN SR2 dependency br 2 Identifying the interaction interface of the IN TRN SR2 interaction and br 3 Studying the effect of IN TRN SR2 interaction mutants on HIV replication br br The effect of the N74D capsid mutant on TRN SR2 dependency br lt gt br Because the N74D capsid mutant wasfound to be insensitive to TRN SR2 knockdown CA was suggested as the main determinant of TRN SR2 mediated nuclear import The first part of myproject thus consisted of studying this N74D capsid mutant and investigating its role in the nuclear import mediated by TRN SR2 When studying the HIV 1 N74D capsid mutant in cells depleted of transportin SR2 I could confirm that it is independent of TRN SR2 when pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein On the other hand a N74D capsid mutant virus carrying the wild type HIV 1 envelope although somewhat less dependent on TRN SR2 than wild type virus still required TRN SR2 forefficient multiple round replication By pseudotyping WT and N74D mutant vectors with envelopes mediating pH independent viral uptake such as HIV 1 measles virus and amphotropic MLV envelopes I could demonstratethat HIV 1 N74D capsid mutant viruses are still dependent on TRN SR2 whereas pseudotyping with envelopes mediating pH dependent endocytosis such as the VSV G and Ebola virus envelopes renders the N74D capsid mutant insensitive to TRN SR2 depletion We thus identified a direct link between the viral entry of HIV and its interaction with TRN SR2 We hypothesized that by playing a role in uncoating trafficking and or docking steps that all precede the specific interaction between IN and TRN SR2 CA may exert an indirect effect on the process of nuclear import br br Identification of the interface of the HIV 1 Integrase Transportin SR2 interaction br lt gt br In a first step towards understanding the exactrole of the IN TRN SR2 interaction I studied the interaction interfacebetween HIV IN and TRN SR2 by applying a peptide based approach to identify the interaction hot spots of both proteins I dissected both IN and TRN SR2 into peptides and used these peptides to identify the crucial amino acids responsible for the interaction I identified one stretch ofamino acids in the CCD IN170 191 and two stretches of amino acids IN214 229 and IN259 274 in the CTD of IN By site directed mutagenesis first in the peptide sequences and then in full length IN I identified

structural fragments fivepeptides retaining the ability to interact with IN were identified TRN24 40 TRN56 74 TRN139 156 TRN288 309 and TRN381 410 Through site specific mutagenesis first in the peptide sequences and then in full length TRN SR2 I defined the following sets of amino acids in TRN SR2 as important for the interaction with IN K27A R29A R39A which only moderatelyaffect the binding

Reveals a Nuclear Import Defect lt gt br br One of the main goals of identifying the interaction interface between IN and TRN SR2 was to use this information to study the exact role of the IN TRN SR2 interaction during HIV replication The major challenge was to find an IN mutant defective for TRN SR2 interaction that would not affect reverse transcription of the virus in order to study its effect on nuclear import of HIV I selected the IN R263A K264A mutant that fails to interact with TRN SR2 and does not perturb reverse transcription allowing us to study the role of the TRN SR2 IN interaction in the nuclear import of thePIC To assess the impact of a deficient IN TRN SR2 interaction on the nuclear import of HIV the IN R263A K264A interface mutations were inserted into a molecular clone of HIV pNL4 3 To study the nuclear import of this virus 2 long terminal repeat 2 LTR circle formation in the nucleus was measured using Q PCR I also performed a direct HIV nuclear import assay using IN eGFP labeled PICs a technique originally created by Albanese et al In both experiments a 2 fold reduction of nuclear importwas evidenced These are the first results that prove that the direct interaction between HIV integrase and TRN SR2 mediates HIV nuclear import br br In conclusion an unexpected link between HIV entry and nuclear import was evidenced demonstrating that care needs to be taken when pseudotyping HIV Detailed molecular interaction mapping suggested IN mutations that next provided evidence that the direct TRN SR2 IN interaction mediates PIC nuclear import and HIV

this atrophy was not observed lt gt br The newly developed assessment tools the instrumented spasticity assessment and the digital MRI segmentation muscle volume assessment proved to be reliable and
